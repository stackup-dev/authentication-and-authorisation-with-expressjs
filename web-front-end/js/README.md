# Scripts.js

This `scripts.js` file allows the user to interact the backend through
the frontend.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod or similar, those URLs might be redirected in VSCode Web (or VSCode desktop). You should check the **Ports** tab of your editor. Your backend's URL
> http://localhost:4001 might be redirected to something like http://orange-marmalade.github.codespace.dev (not a real link). If it is set to private while running, please set it to
> Public by right-clicking the row of where the redirected URL is. Therefore, you have to replace http://localhost:4001 to the new
> URL e.g. http://orange-marmalade.github.codespace.dev for the `BASE_URL`
> variable.
